# SUBC Parser

## Summary
This project contains a lexical analyzer and recursive descent parser for SUBC, which is a subset of the C programming language. The lexical analyzer first converts a sequence of characters from a given input file into a sequence of tokens. Then, it determines whether or not the tokens are valid. The recursive descent parser utilizes the sequence of tokens and grammar rules of SUBC to effectively parse the given input file.

## Tokens of SUBC

The tokens for the SUBC programming language can be found in the "tokens.txt" file.

## Grammar of SUBC

The grammar for the SUBC programming language can be found in the "grammar.txt" file.
